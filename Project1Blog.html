                <h3>Ransomware: Should organizations pay or not?</h3>
                <h4>Cyber, PC</h4>
                <p>
                    Main Topic: Ransomware.
                    Should organizations pay or not? Well sometimes its just not that simple. It's expensive to maintain and keep up with all
                    the expenses needed and software required to securly maintain everything. Sometimes an organization might not be ready for an attack
                    and might not have a choice but to pay. If an organization does pay and retreives their data, it doesnt mean the system is clean and safe.
                    On top of paying to get thier data back, now they face another problem. Whether to continue using that hardware or get new hardware.
                    This can be even more expensive, but you could be at risk using the old hardware as it still could be infected.

                <h3>Are humans really the weakest link in security?</h3>
                <h4>PC, Security</h4>
                <p>
                    Main Topic: Security.
                    Are humans really the weakest link in security? It usually is a humans fault in some type of way when something happens. You could accidently reveal
                    your information or be tricked by a hacker. You can have everything security wise in place and still have an issue due to some human interaction.
                    Whether it be internal or external or both. Theres many methods to bypass security invovling humans. Like social engineering. Sometimes it could just
                    come down to an employee clicking a phishing email or having a weak password. Other times it can be way deeper and a strategic social engineerign scheme
                    to find an in on a company.
